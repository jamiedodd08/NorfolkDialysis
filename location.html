                <h2>Directions</h2>
                <h3>Directions from the South of the A139</h3>
                <p>Dersingham is a medium sized village near the Sandringham Estate. It is just off of the main A149 coast road. 
                    If you are approaching from the south along the A149 you need to turn off at the roundabout sign-posted for Dersingham. 
                    A couple of hundred yards along this road take the first right directly after the village sign. Follow this road until you reach a t-junction, 
                    and turn right at this t-junction. Follow this road until you reach another t-junction, and turn left at this t-junction. Follow this road past the Feathers Public House, 
                    and then the Coach and Horses Public House on your left. You should see the church in front of you, 
                    and just before you reach the church turn right into Church Lane which runs behind the church. 
                    Directly after turning into Church Lane you will see the entrance to St. Nicholas Court. Norfolk Dialysis is the door in the far left corner, next to the solicitors.</p>
                <h3>Directions from the North of the A139</h3>
                <p>If you are approaching from the north along the A149, turn off at the roundabout sign-posted Snettisham. 
                    Follow this road through Snettisham, and keep following it through the next village Ingoldisthorpe. 
                    Approximately half a mile further you will enter the village of Dersingham. Keep going until you reach the traffic lights and turn left at the lights. 
                    Follow this road, and after a sharp right you will see the church on your left. Turn left into Church Lane behind the church itself, 
                    and you will see the entrance to St. Nicholas Court directly on your right.</p>
                <p>Our entrance is in the far left corner just past the solicitors. Please do not use the main entrance to the Carole Brown Health Centre.</p>
